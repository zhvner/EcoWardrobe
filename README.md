#### Personal interest 

Using the Outfit Carbon Tracker would greatly benefit my fashion choices and help me make more informed decisions. 
As a fashion enthusiast, it's important for me to ensure I am making the right choices when it comes to my outfit 
purchases. With the emergence of fast fashion, I am increasingly aware of the detrimental environmental impact caused 
by the industry, including the production of massive amounts of plastic. For instance, polyester, a widely used form of 
plastic derived from oil, has surpassed cotton as the mainstay of textile production, contributing to the global plastic 
waste issue. Additionally, the production of different materials often requires excessive amounts of water. 
To address these concerns, I am committed to becoming more environmentally conscious by using the Outfit Carbon Tracker,
which will allow me to keep a diary of my environmental impact through my daily wardrobe choices.

#### Why use this app?
There are several compelling reasons to use the Outfit Carbon Tracker app. 
Firstly, by utilizing this app, users can gain a deeper understanding of the environmental impact of their fashion choices.
The app goes beyond simply logging outfits by providing crucial information about the water usage and plastic production 
associated with each item.Additionally, the app promotes accountability and encourages individuals to take an active 
role in mitigating the negative effects of the fashion industry. 
By using the Outfit Carbon Tracker, users can contribute to a more sustainable future while still 
enjoying the world of fashion.
